            <p>Ray tracing is a lighting technique that brings an extra level of realism to games. It emulates the way light reflects and refracts in the real world, providing a more believable environment than what is typically seen using static lighting in more traditional games.</p>

            <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/xiaomi-12t-pro-first-200mp-camera-phone/">Xiaomi 12T Pro</a>
            <time> Oct 04, 2022</time>
            <p>The main highlight of the 12T Pro is the rear camera setup. Xiaomi is using a 200MP ISOCELL HP1 1/1.22" sensor with f/1.69 aperture and 8P lens for the primary camera. It can combine data from 16 surrounding pixels to deliver super detailed 12.5MP shots. Xiaomi also takes advantage of the big camera module to offer in-sensor 2x zoom. Sadly, the other cameras are not that impressive. There's an 8MP f/2.2 ultra-wide and a 2MP macro camera. For selfies, you get a 20MP f/2.24 shooter. As for camera modes, you get features like Night mode, Ultra Night video, and 8K video recording.</p>

            <time> Jul 16, 2022</time>
            <p>Samsung expects that its DDR6 design would be finalized by 2024 but commercial usage is not expected after 2025. In terms of specifications, the DDR6 memory will be up to twice as fast as existing DDR5 memory, with transfer speeds of up to 12,800 Mbps (JEDEC) & overclocked speeds blistering past the 17,000 Mbps range. Currently, Samsung's fastest DDR5 DIMM has a transfer speed of up to 7,200 Mbps so that's a 1.7x improvement at JEDEC and 2.36x improvement with overclocked speeds for the next-gen memory chips.</p>
