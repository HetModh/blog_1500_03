        <p>Samsung expects that its DDR6 design would be finalized by 2024 but commercial usage is not expected after 2025. In terms of specifications, the DDR6 memory will be up to twice as fast as existing DDR5 memory, with transfer speeds of up to 12,800 Mbps (JEDEC) & overclocked speeds blistering past the 17,000 Mbps range. Currently, Samsung's fastest DDR5 DIMM has a transfer speed of up to 7,200 Mbps so that's a 1.7x improvement at JEDEC and 2.36x improvement with overclocked speeds for the next-gen memory chips.</p>
